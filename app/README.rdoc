== README

This app was written in Rails v 4.1.3. 

There is no database, so there is no need for any migrations.

Testing is all done with Rails' built-in tester, so it can all be run with 'bin/rake test test/'

This app contains two models, "home" and "map", of these, only the map model is used significantly - to query the LastFM api for a listing of nearby events.

Google Maps api is queried in the maps/index view, in order to render a local map for the user.
