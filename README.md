==========================

The exercise:
1.       Build an app that mashes together Google Maps and LastFM. In particular, LastFM has a robust public API (http://www.last.fm/api), including resources such as a geo.getEvents method to find out what events are upcoming.  Build an app that figures out my current location, grab upcoming events near me from the LastFM API, and show me where those events are as pins on a Google map.  Feel free to include extras about the upcoming events (e.g. list of albums for an artist) or anything else that interests you.

2.       We don't expect you to be a visual designer, but neatness of presentation and general aesthetics count. Adding extra features/touches beyond what I describe above also reflect well. Use your imagination on interesting things to bring in and demonstrate your skills.  Please do include tests.

3.       Commit your code into a repository on github, deploy it somewhere (e.g. Heroku, Digital Ocean, EC2), and share the result with us when you're happy with it.

4.       Language and technology stack are up to you. Our tools of choice tend to be Ruby/Rails on the server side and anything from simple jQuery to full-on ember.js in the browser for client-side interactivity. But you need not use those for this if you're more comfortable in something else. We're more interested in seeing if you can build well written and reasonably tested code than we are in seeing you demonstrate expertise in a particular language or framework. We assume people who are smart enough to do the former can quickly learn new things.

5.       Adding a readme will also help the team understand your reasoning behind your decisions.
